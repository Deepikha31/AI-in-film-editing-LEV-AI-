# AI in Film Editing – Emotion-Driven Cinematic Montage

This project investigates how **artificial intelligence principles can be applied
to creative film editing**, with a focus on emotion-aware cinematic montage design.
The system explores how editing rhythm, sequencing, and temporal structure can be
algorithmically adapted to represent different psychological and emotional states.

Rather than using data-intensive machine learning models, the project adopts a
**rule-based creative AI approach**, where cinematic editing rules are explicitly
designed to encode emotional intent. This choice emphasizes transparency, creative
control, and responsible use of AI in artistic workflows.

The Jupyter Notebook serves as the **single source of truth** for evaluation and
presents the complete system in a structured, narrative format.

## What the Notebook Covers

- **Problem Definition & Objective**  
  Motivation for emotion-aware editing in automated and AI-assisted film workflows.

- **Selected Project Track**  
  Creative AI / Media Systems.

- **Data Understanding & Preparation**  
  Use of short video clips as narrative fragments, with emotion treated as a symbolic
  input rather than inferred personal data.

- **Model / System Design**  
  A rule-based montage architecture mapping emotional states to distinct editing
  strategies (e.g., interruptions, reversals, continuity).

- **Core Implementation**  
  Programmatic logic for assembling cinematic montages based on the selected emotion.

- **Evaluation & Analysis**  
  Qualitative analysis of how different editing patterns communicate emotional tone.

- **Ethical Considerations & Responsible AI**  
  Discussion of creative agency, transparency, and avoidance of psychological profiling.

- **Conclusion & Future Scope**  
  Reflection on limitations and potential extensions of emotion-aware editing systems.

## Execution Note

Due to execution constraints in hosted notebook environments, video rendering is
simulated using mock objects. The system logic and sequencing rules reflect the
original MoviePy-based implementation developed during prototyping.
