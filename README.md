This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a rule-based,
emotion-aware cinematic montage system.

## Main Evaluation File
- **AI_in_Film_Editing.ipynb**

The notebook includes:
- Problem definition & objective
- Selected project track
- Data understanding & preparation
- Model / system design
- Core implementation
- Evaluation & analysis
- Ethical considerations & responsible AI
- Conclusion & future scope

## Execution Note
Due to execution constraints in hosted notebook environments, video rendering
is simulated using mock objects. The system logic reflects the original
MoviePy-based implementation used during prototyping.
